This is slightly whimsical lamppost, created in blender. I kept the
design as simple as possible, and use flat shading and solid colors, so no
texturing here. I would go back and add a texture on the glowing faces to
give them some more detail and depth, but I like the more mellowed out art style
here. I could see this being used in a cell shaded game with a cartoon aesthetic.

I'll be keeping my designs simple and sweet during the start of this adventure,
so I have time to get a rhythm going. This is less about the quality of any one
piece, and more about quantity and exploration.
