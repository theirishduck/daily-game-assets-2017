# Daily Videogame Asset Challenge, for 2017
I'm challenging myself to create one new video game asset (pixel art, sound effect, short musical passage, 3d model, etc) every day. This repository will contain those assets and chronicle my efforts. This is my new year's resolution, and I've never done anything like this before.

I'm not sure what direction this repository will go, so expect this README to be updated and edited as I find my feet. For now however, I'm challenging myself to make one non-programming asset for use in a video game each day. I'll spend no more than an hour on each day's work, will stop when I have a finished idea, and post that work here. My goal is to improve my craft, learn the tools of the trade (or create some of my own in the process), and hopefully end up with a nifty bucket of art assets to use in future games.

Because I'm focusing on improving my craft, I will explicitly be avoiding any existing IP or characters with these assets. This will be whatever original idea my mind comes up with all on its own that day, and any resemblance to existing characters or games is purely coincidental. As such, I'll also be publishing these works with a fairly permissive license. I'm not expecting anything I produce during this challenge to win any design awards, but if you find them useful and want to drop them in your own projects, feel free. I'd love to hear about your work. :)

# Asset Types
I'm interested in producing a wide variety of videogame assets. I won't restrict myself, as I want to see where this project takes me, but these are a few of my starting ideas. I'll document them here for now, and update this list as I figure out what I'm doing.

## Sound Effects and Background Music
I'm a musician and rather annoyed that I don't know how to use very much DAW software. Each Ludum Dare I've participated in has been lackluster in the audio department, often missing sound entirely, which is a shame. I want to learn my way around modern music software. I own and will use Finale Studio for now, and want to pick up FL Studio for synthesizer work. I'm also interested in open source DAW software, and want to play around with LMMS once I've tried something more professional first.

I'll consider any musical idea 4 measures of more in length to be "complete" enough for a day's sketch. I may use my MIDI keyboard to record and compose an idea, but I won't consider the idea complete until I've recorded / transcribed it into some sort of software.

## 3D Models and Animation
I know my way around Blender, but I'm not particularly good at texturing models or creating 2D artwork. I'll consider modeling, texturing, and animating to be separate stages of the game for sketching purposes, meaning that each model can potentially be split out into 3 days of work. I'm particularly interested in low polygon models and efficient use of resources.

## 2D Artwork
I'm no artist. I've never taken a drawing class, and I don't have a sketchbook or a tablet for input. I have *no idea* where I want to go with this. :) I'll consider any reasonably complete artistic idea as a sketch for these purposes. I may do pixel art, I may draw something by hand and scan it in, and I may pick up an actual drawing program.

# Real Life Considerations
I live in a busy house, and I expect this to inspire my mood and motivation. My work schedule is particularly long and hectic. I may be able to produce an asset during my lunch break (conveniently one hour long) but I expect there will be some days where I just don't have the time. That's OK. If I ever miss a sketch, I'll do my best to make it up at the next opportunity, but I also won't beat myself up over it. Life happens. :)
